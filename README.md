# Overview

Azure Logic Apps is a cloud platform where you can create and run automated workflows with little to no code. By using the visual designer and selecting from prebuilt operations, you can quickly build a workflow that integrates and manages your apps, data, services, and systems.

This repository contains our UX focused Logic Apps projects like our new Logic Apps Workflow Designer, as well as our new Data Mapper project.
